# 00_CURRENT_STATE

## Snapshot

- Project: LinkedIn Telegram Directory Bot
- Current STEP: STEP045
- Phase: identity uplift baseline + contact/DM monetization foundation planning
- Primary mode: PRODUCT HARDENING / IDENTITY UPLIFT / MONETIZATION FOUNDATION
- Runtime status: source-clean STEP045 baseline with LinkedIn OIDC identity auto-seed uplift layered on top of the existing member flow and operator/admin plane; live status not confirmed — manual verification required

## What exists now

- LinkedIn OIDC identity bootstrap
- Telegram profile completion, skills, browse, search, intro flow
- operator `/ops` / `/admin` entrypoints with allowlist gating
- Admin / Operations / Communications / System hubs in Russian
- Users, User Card, Notice, Broadcast, Outbox, Intros, Delivery, Quality, Audit
- compact admin counters, trend summaries, funnel drilldowns
- guarded bulk actions from user segments into Notice / Broadcast prep
- STEP045 LinkedIn identity auto-seed uplift for name / given / family / picture / locale persistence
- honest user-facing LinkedIn import summary and manual-fields reminder

## Current truth

- LinkedIn login is still identity bootstrap, not full professional import
- STEP045 auto-seeds only the safe identity layer and only seeds profile display name when the local card name is still empty
- existing manual Telegram profile fields are preserved on reconnect
- public browse still depends on listed + active truth
- contact unlock / member DM / pricing analytics remain planned follow-up steps, not shipped in STEP045

## What must not break

- LinkedIn OIDC flow and callback truth
- Telegram webhook secret guard
- async `createBot()` + awaited `bot.init()`
- listed/active visibility truth
- intro persistence / decision truth
- communications layer and outbox truth
- operator allowlist gating
- docs canon + artifact protocol

## Next recommended step

- implement STEP046 — private Telegram handle + paid contact unlock v1
- keep the rollout narrow: hidden handle, contact policy, paid request, owner approve/decline, controlled reveal

## STEP039.1 delta

- founder/operator-only admin visibility from `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` + `TG_OPERATOR_IDS`
- `/admin` mirrors `/ops` as operator-only fallback

## STEP040 delta

- Russian admin/operator layer
- compact analytics drilldowns and funnel readouts

## STEP041 delta

- safe bulk actions from user segments into Notice / Broadcast prep
- no destructive bulk mutations

## STEP042 delta

- launch/operator runbook added
- freeze policy added
- System hub now exposes `Регламент запуска` and `Freeze`
- release-readiness / handoff / roadmap / start-new-chat prompt aligned to STEP042

## STEP043.1 delta

- live-verification guidance added
- launch-rehearsal guidance added
- System hub now exposes `Live verification` and `Репетиция запуска`
- verification playbook / rehearsal checklist / go-no-go template added

## STEP045 delta

- LinkedIn OIDC claims now normalize and persist basic identity fields more explicitly
- profile draft seeding now fills display name only when the local card name is still empty/blank
- callback success surfaces now state clearly that only the basic identity layer was imported
- hidden/manual professional fields remain Telegram-managed and are not auto-scraped from LinkedIn
